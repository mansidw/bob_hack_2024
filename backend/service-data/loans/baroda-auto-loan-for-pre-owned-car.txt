But this does not apply to salaried employees since car is categorized as a luxury item.    If the car loan is used to purchase a car which is being used for business purposes, then this interest payment gets calculated as your business expense, which can be claimed as a deduction under Section 80C of Income Tax Act.   For example, Assuming you are a self-employed individual who took out a car loan to buy a car for business purpose and your income is Rs.8 lakhs, your interest rate expenses are Rs. 20,000, then you can claim a deduction of Rs. 20,000 under Section 80C of Income Tax Act, such that your taxable income reduces to Rs. 7.8 Lakhs. What is a car loan eligibility calculator?The quantum of finance you can get in the form of a car loan can be calculated by using the car loan eligibility calculator available online. Your car loan eligibility depends on your current income, value of the car you are looking to buy and assessment of your repayment capacity through current expenses or EMIs you are currently servicing. The car loan eligibility calculator helps you to arrive at an estimate of how much loan you can get, based on your inputs on your current income, value of the car, existing EMIs, age, location among other factors, though the factors taken into consideration for calculating car loan eligibility may vary from bank to bank. Are there any prepayment charges for Bank of Baroda’s auto loans?You are allowed to prepay your loan without paying any prepayment charges.
