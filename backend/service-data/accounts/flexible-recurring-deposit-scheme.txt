In case of Monthly Deposit Scheme, the interest shall be calculated for the quarter on compounding basis and paid monthly at discounted value. The interest on Term deposits is calculated by the Bank in accordance with the formulae and conventions advised by Indian Banks' Association. Accordingly Bank has adopted following methodology. “In all cases of Domestic Term Deposits ( period of deposit more than a year) where the terminal quarter is incomplete, interest should be calculated for complete quarter and the actual number of days, reckoning the year 365/366 days viz the calculation of interest on such deposits should be in order of completed quarters and days.” 	For Deposits of 2 Quarters and above, interest is calculated in quarterly compounded for complete quarters and where the terminal quarter incomplete, interest is calculated proportionately for the actual no of days reckoning the year 365/366 days. 	The Maturity Amount mentioned in the receipt is calculated without giving TDS effect. While calculating interest for half year(Quarterly compounded), the interest calculated for previous half year (quarterly compounded) minus TDS will be added to principal amount for calculating interest for current Half Year. 	For Short Deposits of less than 2 quarters but more than 1 quarter simple interest will be paid for complete quarter and plus interest for remaining days reckoning the year 365-366 days( without compound effect).	For short deposits of less than one quarter interest is calculated proportionately for actual number for days reckoning the year 365-366 days. The interest on FCNR deposits shall be paid at the rates calculated in accordance with the basis prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from time to time for various maturities. The interest on FCNR deposits shall be paid on the basis of 360 days to a year and shall be calculated at intervals of 180 days each.

Further it has also been made compulsory to mention PAN on form No.15G / 15H w.e.f. 1st April 2010.The Bank will issue a system generated tax deduction certificate (TDS Certificate) for the amount of tax deducted on quarterly basis.  Interest earned/accrued on NRE & FCNR Term Deposits is tax free in India under the relevant provisions of Income Tax Act in India and hence no tax at source is deductible in respect of these deposits. “In case of NRO deposits” The depositor can claim the benefit of reduced rates of tax under Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), which India has with the governments of various countries, by submitting the documents prescribed by the Bank at the beginning of every financial year. However, Bank has statutory obligation to deduct tax at source on any interest paid / payable on NRO Term Deposits at the specified rates. If PAN is submitted with a declaration applicable under Double Tax Avoidance Treaty - TDS is deducted @ applicable rate for the country of residence of the customer. If PAN is submitted without declaration - TDS is deducted @30% 	If declaration is submitted without PAN - TDS @normal rate or 20% whichever is higher. 	If PAN and declaration is not submitted - TDS @30%  All interest payments will be rounded off to the nearest rupee.  The Term Deposit account holders at the time of placing their deposits can give instructions with regard to closure of Deposit account or renewal of deposit for further period on the date of maturity. In absence of such mandate, the Bank will automatically renew the deposit as under. 	If Deposit is placed for more than one year it will be automatically renewed for one year at the prevailing rate on due date. 	 If Deposit is placed for less than one year it will be automatically renewed for same period at the prevailing rate on due date. In case, the customer wishes to make changes in the tenure or wants premature proceeds of the Term deposit, the same is allowed at the written request of the customer.
