No. That would be a fairy-tale. Yes, it depreciates.This brings us to the next important point regarding a motor insurance policyDepreciation- Only for the purpose of total loss and fixing the IDV, below is how the depreciation in IDV is scheduled.-Age of Vehicle% of Depreciation for Fixing IDVNot exceeding 6 months5%Exceeding 6 months but not exceeding 1 year15%Exceeding 1 months but not exceeding 2 year20%Exceeding 2 months but not exceeding 3 year30%Exceeding 3 months but not exceeding 4 year40%Exceeding 4 months but not exceeding 5 year50%Similarly, the body parts of the car are subject to depreciation too. You can check that schedule in the policy document at leisure.As Indians, we are very used to that something extra. Even the vegetable shopping entails some extra coriander and chillies in your bag. Feels good, doesn't it? We understand.
